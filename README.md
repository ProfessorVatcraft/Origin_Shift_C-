My professor told our class to describe an algorithm that is not in the lecture. 
I decided to go with Captain Luma's Origin Shift Algorithm because it's an interesting algorithm and I basically have an excuse to talk about Minecraft lol.
The program doesn't have any graphics. Everything is done in the console.
So yes it won't look as nice as Captain Luma one but I'm still like a beginner/early itermidiate C++ programmer
Anyways, have fun messing around!
Here is the original Algorithm :]
